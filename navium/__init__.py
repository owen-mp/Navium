Navium is a lightweight browser automation library that leverages Chromium's DevTools Protocol for direct control of the browser via WebSockets.
Designed for flexibility and ease of use, Navium allows developers to automate browsing tasks like page navigation, JavaScript execution, and WebSocket communication.
While it focuses on low-level protocol commands and browser management, Navium provides the foundation for advanced automation scenarios, including testing, scraping, and custom browsing workflows.
